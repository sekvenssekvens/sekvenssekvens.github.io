## DJ Berrin Baş

DJ Berrin Baş – A Sound Journey Through the S.W.A.N.A. Regions

With roots in Turkey and a childhood shaped in Jutland, DJ Berrin Baş shapes her heritage into a musical expression that feels both grounded and open. Whether through her work with the Danish-Turkish psych band TUHAF or her solo DJ sets, she explores the emotional and rhythmic depth of the S.W.A.N.A. regions.

Her connection to music runs deep – not through formal training, but through lived experience. Summers spent in Türkiye, surrounded by family and everyday sounds, have become part of her musical language. Those memories continue to resonate in her musical choices, gently guiding the atmosphere she creates.

Rather than following trends, Berrin Baş follows feeling. Her selections are intuitive and sincere, shaped by a desire to share something real – not just to entertain, but to connect.
